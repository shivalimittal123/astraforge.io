## 🚀 Why AstraForge-io?

Traditional automation frameworks break often and require constant maintenance. AstraForge.io brings intelligence, resilience, and automation together.

- 🧠 **AI Test Generation:** Create test plans automatically based on past test data and domain knowledge.  
- 🔍 **Deep Scanner:** Intelligent UI element detection with self-healing locators (CSS/XPath/Accessibility).  
- 🔄 **Modular Integrations:** Plug in your favorite test executor — *Cypress*, *Selenium*, or *Playwright*.  
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics:** Real-time dashboards, ML-based flakiness detection, and predictive insights.  
- 🧩 **Knowledge Feedback Loop:** Learns from execution results to improve future tests automatically.  
- 🔐 **Built-in Security & Performance Checks:** OWASP compliance, APM metrics, and trend reports.
